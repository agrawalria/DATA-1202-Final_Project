# DATA-1202-Final_Project
## About Project
This is a DATA-1202 Project where we will take 2 datasets through which we analyze the relationship between sleep, health, and lifestyle and how they are affecting each other.

## DATA SOURCE USED
The Dataset is taken from Kaggle and it's in CSV format. 
### Dataset Overview:
The sleep health and lifestyle dataset has 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. This includes details such as gender, age, occupation, hours slept, quality of sleep, physical activity, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, steps taken each day, and sleep disturbances.
### Dataset Columns:
- Person ID: An identifier for each individual.
- Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).
- Age: The age of the person in years.
- Occupation: The occupation or profession of the person.
- Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the person sleeps per day.
- Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.
- Physical Activity Level (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.
- Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.
- BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
- Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.
- Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.
- Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.
- Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea-breathing pause while sleeping).
### Key Feature of Dataset:
- Sleep Metric: Explore sleep duration, quality, and factors influencing sleep patterns.
- Health: Examine blood pressure and heart rate measurements.
- Lifestyle Factors: Analyze physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories.
- Sleep disorder Analysis

## STEP FOLLOWED
- Extract data from the sources and import it into the database MySQL. 
- Apply some transformation to clean and make the data useful using SQL query.
- Load useful data in the target for further analysis by analysts and create reports to provide insight about the business issues.
